# This Artical Told us how to be a good developer 
* **Conceiving The Purpose of Software**
    *  single purpose of all software: **To help people.**
* **The Goals of Software Design**
    * makes the project as easily as possible  for the users
* **(Mis)understanding**
    * good developer understand what they are doing
* **Simplicity**
    * make the project is esiear for users 
* **Complexity**
    * be a way from making your system hard to users 
* **Maintenance**
    * It is more important to reduce the effort of maintenance than it is to reduce the effort of implementation.
* **Consistency**
    * make your code easier to other developers 
* **Prioritizing**
    * its very good to have a to do list , so your priority clear
* **Solving Problems**
    * be very good in solve problem
* **Good enough is fine**
    * be a kind person

* **Stop Reinventing**
    * dont remake the wheels from zero
* **Resistance**
    * As a developer, your first reaction to changing requests should be “NO’’.

* **Automation**
     * If you can automate it, automate it.

* **Code measurement**
     * You can achieve simplicity with a little bunch of code and solve the problem.
* **Productivity**
    * Your main goal should be keeping your code base as small as possible.
* **Testing**
    * Untested code is the code that doesn’t work.

* **Estimation**
    * Everything takes longer than you think.
* **Running Away From Rewriting**
    * Rewriting code is often a developer delusion, not the solution in most cases.
* **Documentation and Commenting**
    * Write a comment to explain “WHY”, not to explain “WHAT”.

* **Picking Technologies (Tools, Libraries, etc.)**
     * Don’t depend on external technologies. But when you have to do so, try to reduce your dependency on them as much as you can.
* **Self-Development**
    * Use the required technology to solve a specific problem
* **Don’t be a hero**
    * Don’t be obsessive. Know when to quit. Don’t hesitate to ask for help.

* **Don’t Ask Questions… Ask For Help**
    * always search !!
